// It's pretty straightforward.
// Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
// You're given one parameter, the original string.
// You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.
//UsinG the PREP Approach
// Input are single string with atleast two characters
// the same string return without the first and last characters
function removeChar(str) {
return str.slice(1, -1)
}
